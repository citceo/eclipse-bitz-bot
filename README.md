# Eclipse BITZ Mining Telegram Bot

Welcome to the Eclipse BITZ Mining Telegram Bot! ðŸš€ This bot makes it super easy to manage your BITZ mining on the Eclipse network. With a clean menu, you can check your BITZ and ETH balance, start or stop mining, claim tokens, switch RPC links, and moreâ€”all from Telegram. Plus, all messages auto-delete after 60 seconds for privacy. ðŸŒŒ

Whether you're a crypto newbie or a pro, this guide will walk you through every step to set up and run the bot, with commands you can copy and paste. Let's get started!

## What This Bot Does
- **Check Balance**: See your BITZ and ETH balance in a nicely formatted message.
- **Start/Stop Mining**: Launch or halt mining with the `bitz collect` command.
- **Claim Tokens**: Claim your BITZ tokens with a confirmation step to avoid mistakes.
- **Manage Screen Sessions**: Check or terminate background mining processes.
- **Switch RPC Links**: Update the RPC endpoint for mining with a simple text input.
- **Coming Soon**: A placeholder for exciting future features!
- **Privacy First**: All bot messages vanish after 60 seconds.
- **Secure Setup**: Uses environment variables to keep your sensitive info safe.

## Who Can Use This?
Anyone with a Linux system (like an Ubuntu VPS) and a Telegram account! No advanced coding skills neededâ€”just follow the steps below, and you'll have your bot running in no time.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have:
1. **A Linux System**: Ubuntu 20.04 or later is ideal (e.g., a VPS from DigitalOcean, AWS, or Google Cloud). Windows/macOS users can set up a Linux VM or VPS.
2. **Internet Access**: To download files, interact with Telegram, and connect to the Eclipse network.
3. **A Telegram Account**: For creating and using the bot.
4. **An Eclipse Wallet**: You'll need a wallet address and keypair for mining.
5. **Basic Terminal Access**: Youâ€™ll use a terminal (like PuTTY for VPS or Terminal on Linux) to run commands.
6. **Time**: About 15â€“30 minutes to set everything up, depending on your system.

Don't worry if any of this sounds unfamiliarâ€”the steps below explain everything in detail!

## Step-by-Step Setup Guide
Follow these steps exactly, copying and pasting commands into your terminal. Weâ€™ll assume youâ€™re using a fresh Ubuntu 20.04 VPS, but the steps are similar for other Linux systems. If you hit any snags, check the **Troubleshooting** section at the end.

### Step 1: Log In to Your Linux System
1. Open your terminal:
   - **On a VPS**: Use PuTTY (Windows) or `ssh` (Linux/macOS). For example:

     ```bash
     ssh username@your-vps-ip
     ```

     Replace `username` and `your-vps-ip` with your VPS details (e.g., `ssh ubuntu@192.168.1.1`).
   - **On a local Linux machine**: Open the Terminal app (search for "Terminal" or press `Ctrl+Alt+T`).
2. If prompted, enter your password. Youâ€™re now in the terminal!

- **What this does**: Connects you to your Linux system where youâ€™ll run all commands.
- **Time**: 1 minute.
- **Tip**: If you donâ€™t have a VPS, sign up for one (e.g., DigitalOcean) or use a local Linux machine.

### Step 2: Update Your System
Keep your system up to date to avoid software issues:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```


What to expect: The terminal will download package lists and install updates. It might take a few minutes.

What this does: Ensures your system has the latest security patches and software.

Time: 2â€“5 minutes, depending on your internet and system.

Tip: If asked for a password, use your VPS or user password. If it hangs, check your internet connection.

Step 3: Install Python
The bot needs Python 3.8 or higher to run. Check if itâ€™s installed:

 ```bash

python3 --version
```
What to expect: If you see Python 3.8.x or higher (e.g., Python 3.10.12), skip to Step 4.

If not: If you get an error or a lower version, install Python:

 ```bash

sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-venv -y
```
Verify Python and its tools:

 ```bash

python3 --version
pip3 --version
```
Expected output:
Python 3.8.x or higher (e.g., Python 3.10.12).

pip 20.x.x or similar (e.g., pip 22.0.2).

What this does: Installs Python (the botâ€™s language), pip (for installing libraries), and venv (for isolating the botâ€™s setup).

Time: 1â€“3 minutes.

Tip: If you get errors, rerun sudo apt-get update.

Step 4: Install screen
The bot uses screen to run mining processes in the background, so they continue even if you close your terminal. Install it:
 ```bash

sudo apt-get install screen -y
```
Check itâ€™s installed:
 ```bash

screen --version
```
Expected output: Something like Screen version 4.08.00.

What this does: Adds screen, a tool for managing long-running tasks like mining.

Time: Less than a minute.

Tip: If the install fails, check your internet or rerun the command.

Step 5: Install git
You need git to download the botâ€™s code from GitHub:
 ```bash

sudo apt-get install git -y
```
Verify itâ€™s installed:
 ```bash

git --version
```
Expected output: Something like git version 2.34.1.

What this does: Installs git, which lets you clone the botâ€™s repository.

Time: Less than a minute.

Tip: If you get a "command not found" error, ensure sudo apt-get update ran successfully.

Step 6: Clone the Botâ€™s Repository
Download the botâ€™s code from GitHub:
 ```bash

git clone https://github.com/citceo/eclipse-bitz-bot.git
cd eclipse-bitz-bot
```
What to expect: This creates a folder called eclipse-bitz-bot with the botâ€™s files and moves you into it.

What this does: Copies the botâ€™s code to your system so you can set it up.

Time: 1â€“2 minutes, depending on your internet speed.

Tip: If you get a "repository not found" error:
Check the link matches your GitHub repo (e.g., https://github.com/citceo/eclipse-bitz-bot.git).

Ensure the repo is public (in GitHub settings).

If you used a different repo name, replace citceo/eclipse-bitz-bot with your own.

Step 7: Set Up a Virtual Environment
A virtual environment keeps the botâ€™s libraries separate to avoid conflicts with other programs:
 ```bash

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
What to expect: After the second command, your terminal prompt will show (venv), meaning the environment is active.

What this does:
Creates a venv folder for the botâ€™s libraries.

Activates the environment so commands like pip only affect the bot.

Time: Less than a minute.

Tip: If you close your terminal later, reactivate with:

 ```bash

source venv/bin/activate
```
Step 8: Install Python Libraries
Install the botâ€™s required libraries using the requirements.txt file:
 ```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This installs everything listed in requirements.txt:
plaintext

python-telegram-bot==20.7
psutil
requests
python-dotenv

If requirements.txt doesnâ€™t work, install manually:
 ```bash

pip install python-telegram-bot==20.7
pip install "python-telegram-bot[job-queue]"
pip install psutil requests python-dotenv
```
Verify the libraries:
 ```bash

pip list
```
Expected output: Youâ€™ll see:
python-telegram-bot (version 20.7)

psutil

requests

python-dotenv

Plus some dependencies like httpx.

What this does:
python-telegram-bot: Runs the Telegram bot.

job-queue: Auto-deletes messages after 60 seconds.

psutil: Manages mining processes.

requests: Handles network tasks.

python-dotenv: Loads sensitive settings securely.

Time: 1â€“3 minutes.

Tip: If errors occur, update pip:

 ```bash

pip install --upgrade pip
```
Step 9: Install the bitz CLI Tool
The bot uses the bitz CLI to interact with the Eclipse network for mining and wallet tasks. Eclipse provides the bitz CLI, but youâ€™ll need their official instructions to install it (check their website, GitHub, or Discord). Since I donâ€™t have the exact steps, hereâ€™s a placeholderâ€”youâ€™ll need to replace it with the real commands:
Download the bitz CLI (exampleâ€”find the correct link):

 ```bash

wget https://example.com/bitz-cli-latest-linux
```
Make it executable and move it to a system path:

 ```bash

chmod +x bitz-cli-latest-linux
sudo mv bitz-cli-latest-linux /usr/local/bin/bitz
```
Check itâ€™s installed:

 ```bash

bitz --version
```
Expected output: Something like bitz version x.y.z (depends on the tool).

What this does: Installs bitz, which the bot uses to check balances, mine, and claim tokens.

Time: 2â€“5 minutes, depending on Eclipseâ€™s instructions.

Important: To find the real bitz installation steps:
Visit Eclipseâ€™s Discord: https://discord.gg/eclipse-fnd (#powpow).

Check their website or GitHub for CLI documentation.

Tip: If you canâ€™t install bitz yet, proceed with setup and return to this step before mining. The bot will still run for other tasks.

Step 10: Create a Telegram Bot
You need a Telegram bot to interact with the code:
Open Telegram (on your phone or computer) and search for @BotFather.

Start BotFather:

 ```bash

/start
```
Create a new bot:

 ```bash

/newbot
```
Follow the prompts:
Name: Pick anything, like "Eclipse BITZ Bot".

Username: Must end in "Bot", like @MyEclipseBitzBot.

BotFather will give you a Bot Token, looking like:

1234567890:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890

Copy the token and save it somewhere safe (e.g., a text file or password manager).

What this does: Registers your bot with Telegram so it can send and receive messages.

Time: 2 minutes.

Tip: Donâ€™t share the tokenâ€”itâ€™s like a password for your bot.

Step 11: Find Your Telegram Chat ID
The bot only responds to you (or a specific chat) for security. To get your Chat ID:
In Telegram, search for @userinfobot.

Start it:

 ```bash

/start
```
It will reply with your Chat ID, like:

123456789

Copy the Chat ID and save it.

What this does: Tells the bot whoâ€™s allowed to use it, keeping it private.

Time: 1 minute.

Tip: If you want the bot in a group, add it to the group and use /start@UserInfoBot to get the groupâ€™s Chat ID.

Step 12: Set Up Your Eclipse Wallet
You need an Eclipse wallet address and a keypair file for mining:
Wallet Address:
If you have the bitz CLI installed, check your wallet:

 ```bash

bitz account
```
This should show your address, like:

YourWalletAddress123...

Copy the address and save it.

If bitz isnâ€™t installed yet, skip this and return after Step 9.

Solana Keypair:
The bot expects a keypair at ~/.config/solana/id.json. Create one:

 ```bash

mkdir -p ~/.config/solana
```
If bitz supports key generation:

 ```bash

bitz keygen --outfile ~/.config/solana/id.json
```
If not, use the Solana CLI to create a keypair:

 ```bash

sudo apt-get install curl -y
curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/stable/install | sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"
solana-keygen new --outfile ~/.config/solana/id.json
```
When prompted, set a passphrase (or press Enter for none). Back up the passphrase or seed phrase securely.

Verify the keypair file:

 ```bash

ls -l ~/.config/solana/id.json
```
Critical: This file is your private key. Never share it, and back it up (e.g., on an encrypted USB drive).

What this does: Sets up your wallet so the bot can check balances, mine, and claim tokens.

Time: 2â€“5 minutes.

Tip: If bitz account fails, ensure bitz is installed and your wallet has some ETH (at least 0.005 for mining).

Step 13: Configure Environment Variables
The bot uses a .env file to store sensitive info like your bot token. Create it:
```bash

cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```
Youâ€™ll see the contents of .env.example:
plaintext

BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
CHAT_ID=your_telegram_chat_id
WALLET_ADDRESS=your_wallet_address
RPC_URL=https://mainnetbeta-rpc.eclipse.xyz

Replace the placeholders with your values, for example:
plaintext

BOT_TOKEN=1234567890:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890
CHAT_ID=123456789
WALLET_ADDRESS=YourWalletAddress123...
RPC_URL=https://mainnetbeta-rpc.eclipse.xyz

Save and exit:
Press Ctrl+O, then Enter to save.

Press Ctrl+X to exit.

Verify the file:
```bash

cat .env
```
What to expect: Youâ€™ll see your settings (donâ€™t share this output!).

What this does: Stores your bot token, Chat ID, wallet address, and RPC link securely so the bot can use them.

Time: 2 minutes.

Tip: The default RPC_URL works for Eclipse, but you can change it later using the botâ€™s "RPC" button.

Step 14: Test the Bot
Letâ€™s see if the bot works! Run it:
 ```bash

python3 bitz_bot.py
```
If the virtual environment isnâ€™t active:

 ```bash

source venv/bin/activate
python3 bitz_bot.py
```
What to expect:
The terminal may show logs but shouldnâ€™t crash.

Open Telegram, find your bot (e.g., @MyEclipseBitzBot), and send:

 ```bash

/start
```
You should see:

Welcome to your Eclipse Mining Assistant! ðŸŒŒ
Select an option below to manage your wallet and mining:
Support: https://discord.gg/eclipse-fnd (#powpow)
X: https://x.com/0xAsta2025

A menu with these buttons:
Start

Bitz Collect

Bitz Claim

Bitz Account

Check Screen

Kill All Screens

Coming Soon

RPC

Test the buttons:
Coming Soon: Should say "Coming soon..." and delete after 60 seconds.

Bitz Account: Should show your wallet balance (if bitz and keypair are set up).

RPC: Should prompt for a new RPC link.

Start: Should check if mining is running.

All messages should disappear after 60 seconds.

What this does: Confirms the bot is working and responding to commands.

Time: 2â€“3 minutes.

Tip: If nothing happens, check the Troubleshooting section.

Step 15: Run the Bot in the Background
To keep the bot running 24/7 (e.g., on a VPS):
Start a screen session:

 ```bash

screen -S bot
```
Activate the virtual environment and run the bot:

 ```bash

source venv/bin/activate
python3 bitz_bot.py
```
Detach from the session to leave it running:

Press Ctrl+A, then D

What to expect: Youâ€™ll see [detached from 12345.bot] or similar, and the bot keeps running.

What this does: Lets the bot stay active even if you close your terminal.

To check on the bot later:

 ```bash

screen -r bot
```
To stop the bot:
Return to the session:

 ```bash

screen -r bot
```
Stop the bot:

 ```bash

Press Ctrl+C
```
Exit the session:

 ```bash

exit
```
What this does: Makes the bot reliable for long-term use, like mining.

Time: 1 minute.

Tip: If screen -r bot shows no session, restart with Step 15.1.

Troubleshooting
Hit a problem? Hereâ€™s how to fix common issues with commands you can copy and paste:
Bot doesnâ€™t respond in Telegram:
Check the botâ€™s log for errors:

 ```bash

cat bitz_bot.log
```
Verify your .env file:

 ```bash

cat .env
```
Ensure BOT_TOKEN and CHAT_ID match what you got from BotFather and UserInfoBot.

Restart the bot:

 ```bash

source venv/bin/activate
python3 bitz_bot.py
```
Error: "command not found: bitz":
The bitz CLI isnâ€™t installed. Revisit Step 9 and find Eclipseâ€™s installation guide (website, GitHub, or Discord).

Test if bitz is available:

 ```bash

bitz --version
```
Messages donâ€™t auto-delete:
Ensure the job-queue library is installed:

 ```bash

pip install "python-telegram-bot[job-queue]"
```
Restart the bot:

 ```bash

python3 bitz_bot.py
```
Mining fails with "Error: insufficient balance":
Your wallet needs at least 0.005 ETH. Check your balance:

 ```bash

bitz account --keypair ~/.config/solana/id.json --rpc https://mainnetbeta-rpc.eclipse.xyz
```
Fund your wallet via an Eclipse-compatible exchange or faucet (ask in Discord for faucets).

Keypair errors:
Verify the keypair file exists:

 ```bash

ls -l ~/.config/solana/id.json
```
If missing, recreate it (Step 12).

Fix permissions if needed:

 ```bash

chmod 600 ~/.config/solana/id.json
```
"Permission denied" errors:
Fix file ownership:

 ```bash

sudo chown $USER:$USER ~/.config/solana/id.json
```
Or run commands with sudo if appropriate.

Bot crashes with Python errors:
Ensure all libraries are installed:

 ```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Update pip:

 ```bash

pip install --upgrade pip
```

```
Security Tips
Keep your bot and wallet safe:
Never share .env or keypair: Your .env file and ~/.config/solana/id.json contain sensitive data. Donâ€™t upload them to GitHub or share them.

Back up your keypair: Copy ~/.config/solana/id.json to a secure place (e.g., an encrypted USB):

 ```bash

cp ~/.config/solana/id.json ~/backup-id.json
```
Secure your VPS: Use strong passwords and enable a firewall:

 ```bash

sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw allow ssh
```
Update regularly: Keep your system secure:

 ```bash

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```
Monitor logs: Check for suspicious activity:

 ```bash

cat bitz_bot.log
```
Revoke bot token if leaked: If you think your token was exposed, use BotFather:

 ```bash

/revoke
```
  Then update .env with the new token.
Advanced Usage
Once the bot is running, hereâ€™s how to make the most of it:
Monitor Balance: Use Bitz Account to check your BITZ and ETH regularly.

Run Mining: Click Bitz Collect to start mining in a screen session. Itâ€™ll keep going even if you disconnect.

Claim Tokens: Use Bitz Claim to collect mined BITZ. Confirm carefully to avoid errors.

Change RPC: If the default RPC is slow, use RPC to enter a new link (e.g., a premium endpoint).

Manage Sessions: Use Check Screen to list running sessions and Kill All Screens to stop them if needed.

Stay Updated: Click Coming Soon to see if new features are added (itâ€™s just a placeholder for now).

To check mining status manually:
 ```bash

screen -r eclipse_bitz
```
To stop a mining session:
 ```bash

screen -S eclipse_bitz -X quit
```
