# Eclipse BITZ Mining Telegram Bot

Welcome to the Eclipse BITZ Mining Telegram Bot! ðŸš€ This bot lets you manage your BITZ mining on the Eclipse network right from Telegram. With a simple menu, you can check your BITZ and ETH balance, start or stop mining, claim tokens, switch RPC links, and more. All messages auto-delete after 60 seconds for privacy. ðŸŒŒ

If youâ€™ve already set up Rust, Solana CLI, `bitz` CLI, and your Eclipse wallet, this guide will help you get the bot running quickly. Just copy and paste the commands below, and youâ€™ll be controlling your mining from Telegram in no time!

## What This Bot Does
- **Check Balance**: View your BITZ and ETH balance in a clear message.
- **Start/Stop Mining**: Run or halt mining with the `bitz collect` command.
- **Claim Tokens**: Claim your BITZ tokens with a confirmation step.
- **Manage Screen Sessions**: Check or stop background mining processes.
- **Switch RPC Links**: Update the RPC endpoint with a text input.
- **Coming Soon**: Placeholder for future features!
- **Privacy First**: Messages vanish after 60 seconds.
- **Secure Setup**: Uses environment variables to keep your info safe.

## Who Can Use This?
Anyone with a Linux system (like an Ubuntu VPS), a Telegram account, and the `bitz` CLI already installed. No coding skills neededâ€”just follow the steps below.

## Prerequisites
This guide assumes youâ€™ve already:
1. **Installed Rust**: Using `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh` and sourced the environment.
2. **Installed Solana CLI**: Using `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://solana-install.solana.workers.dev | bash`.
3. **Created an Eclipse Wallet**: With `solana-keygen new`, saved at `~/.config/solana/id.json`, and backed up your public key and mnemonic.
4. **Installed `bitz` CLI**: Using `cargo install bitz`.
5. **Set an RPC Endpoint**: Configured with `solana config set --url https://mainnetbeta-rpc.eclipse.xyz/` (or another Eclipse RPC).
6. **Funded Your Wallet**: Sent at least 0.005 ETH to your public key for mining.
7. **Tested Mining**: Ran `bitz collect` in a `screen` session and know how to detach/reattach.

Youâ€™ll also need:
- **A Linux System**: Ubuntu 20.04 or later (e.g., a VPS or local Linux machine).
- **Internet Access**: To download files and connect to Telegram.
- **A Telegram Account**: To create and use the bot.
- **Terminal Access**: To run commands (e.g., PuTTY for VPS or Terminal on Linux).
- **Time**: About 10â€“20 minutes to set up the bot.

If any of this sounds unfamiliar, double-check your setup or ask for help in the [Eclipse Discord](https://discord.gg/eclipse-fnd) (#powpow).

## Step-by-Step Setup Guide
Follow these steps, copying and pasting commands into your terminal. We assume youâ€™re using an Ubuntu 20.04 VPS with `bitz` CLI already installed. If you hit issues, check the **Troubleshooting** section.

### Step 1: Log In to Your Linux System
1. Open your terminal:
   - **On a VPS**: Use PuTTY (Windows) or `ssh` (Linux/macOS):

```bash
ssh username@your-vps-ip
```
 Replace `username` and `your-vps-ip` with your VPS details (e.g., `ssh ubuntu@192.168.1.1`).


On a local Linux machine: Open Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T).

Enter your password if prompted.

What this does: Gets you into your Linux system to run commands.

Time: Less than a minute.

### Step 2: Update Your System
Ensure your system is up to date:
```bash

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```
What to expect: Downloads and installs updates. May take a few minutes.

What this does: Keeps your system secure and compatible.

Time: 1â€“5 minutes.

Tip: If prompted, enter your password. If it hangs, check your internet.

### Step 3: Verify bitz CLI and Wallet
Confirm your bitz CLI and wallet are ready:
Check bitz CLI:

```bash

bitz --version
```
Expected output: Something like bitz version x.y.z.

If you get "command not found," reinstall bitz with:

```bash

cargo install bitz
```
Verify your keypair:

```bash

ls -l ~/.config/solana/id.json
```
Expected output: Shows the file exists (e.g., -rw------- 1 user user ... id.json).

If missing, recreate it (but back up any existing wallet first):

```bash

solana-keygen new --outfile ~/.config/solana/id.json
```
Check your wallet balance:

```bash

bitz account
```
Expected output: Shows your BITZ and ETH balance (e.g., 0.005 ETH).

If you have less than 0.005 ETH, send more to your public key via an exchange.

What this does: Ensures bitz CLI works and your wallet is funded.

Time: 1â€“3 minutes.

Tip: If bitz account fails, check your RPC:

```bash

solana config get
```
   Set it if needed:
```bash

solana config set --url https://mainnetbeta-rpc.eclipse.xyz/
```
### Step 4: Install Python
The bot needs Python 3.8 or higher. Check if itâ€™s installed:
```bash

python3 --version
```
What to expect:
If you see Python 3.8.x or higher (e.g., Python 3.10.12), skip to Step 5.

If not, install Python:

```bash

sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-venv -y
```
Verify:
```bash

python3 --version
pip3 --version
```
Expected output:
Python 3.8.x or higher.

pip 20.x.x or similar.

What this does: Installs Python, pip (for libraries), and venv (for isolation).

Time: 1â€“3 minutes.

### Step 5: Install screen
If youâ€™ve used screen for mining, itâ€™s probably installed. Confirm:
```bash

screen --version
```
What to expect: Output like Screen version 4.08.00.

If not installed, add it:

```bash

sudo apt-get install screen -y
```
What this does: Allows the bot to manage mining sessions.

Time: Less than a minute.

### Step 6: Install git
You need git to download the botâ€™s code:
```bash

sudo apt-get install git -y
```
Verify:
```bash

git --version
```
Expected output: Something like git version 2.34.1.

What this does: Installs git for cloning the repository.

Time: Less than a minute.

### Step 7: Clone the Botâ€™s Repository
Download the botâ€™s code:
```bash

git clone https://github.com/citceo/eclipse-bitz-bot.git
cd eclipse-bitz-bot
```
What to expect: Creates a folder eclipse-bitz-bot and moves you into it.

What this does: Gets the botâ€™s files onto your system.

Time: 1â€“2 minutes.

Tip: If the clone fails, check the repo URL (https://github.com/citceo/eclipse-bitz-bot.git) or your internet.

### Step 8: Set Up a Virtual Environment
Create a virtual environment to keep the botâ€™s libraries separate:
```bash

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
What to expect: Your prompt shows (venv) after activation.

What this does: Isolates the botâ€™s dependencies.

Time: Less than a minute.

Tip: Reactivate later with:

```bash

source venv/bin/activate
```
### Step 9: Install Python Libraries
Install the botâ€™s required libraries:
```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If that doesnâ€™t work, install manually:
```bash

pip install python-telegram-bot==20.7
pip install "python-telegram-bot[job-queue]"
pip install psutil requests python-dotenv
```
Verify:
```bash

pip list
```
Expected output:
python-telegram-bot (version 20.7)

psutil

requests

python-dotenv

What this does:
python-telegram-bot: Runs the bot.

job-queue: Deletes messages after 60 seconds.

psutil: Manages processes.

requests: Handles network calls.

python-dotenv: Loads secure settings.

Time: 1â€“3 minutes.

Tip: Update pip if errors occur:

```bash

pip install --upgrade pip
```
### Step 10: Create a Telegram Bot
Set up a Telegram bot for the code:
Open Telegram and search for @BotFather.

Send:

```bash

/start
```
Create a bot:

```bash

/newbot
```
Follow prompts:
Name: Anything (e.g., "Eclipse BITZ Bot").

Username: Must end in "Bot" (e.g., @MyEclipseBitzBot).

Copy the Bot Token (e.g., 1234567890:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890) and save it.

What this does: Registers your bot with Telegram.

Time: 2 minutes.

Tip: Keep the token private.

### Step 11: Find Your Telegram Chat ID
The bot only responds to you for security:
In Telegram, search for @userinfobot.

Send:

```bash

/start
```
Copy the Chat ID (e.g., 123456789) from the reply.

What this does: Restricts bot access to you.

Time: 1 minute.

Tip: For group chats, add the bot to the group and use /start@getidsbot.

### Step 12: Configure Environment Variables
Set up the botâ€™s settings:
Copy the example file:

```bash

cp .env.example .env
```
Edit it:

```bash

nano .env
```
Replace placeholders with your values, like:

```plaintext

BOT_TOKEN=1234567890:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890
CHAT_ID=123456789
WALLET_ADDRESS=YourWalletAddress123...
RPC_URL=https://mainnetbeta-rpc.eclipse.xyz
```
Use your walletâ€™s public key from bitz account.

Keep the RPC URL from your solana config get output.

Save and exit:
Ctrl+O, Enter to save.

Ctrl+X to exit.

Verify:

```bash

cat .env
```
What this does: Stores your bot token, chat ID, wallet address, and RPC securely.

Time: 2 minutes.

Tip: Ensure no typos in .env.

### Step 13: Test the Bot
Run the bot to check it works:
```bash

python3 bitz_bot.py
```
If the virtual environment isnâ€™t active:

```bash

source venv/bin/activate
python3 bitz_bot.py
```
What to expect:
Terminal shows logs (no errors).

In Telegram, send /start to your bot (e.g., @MyEclipseBitzBot):
```
